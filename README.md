# hello-world
# Getting started

## Welcome to my first repository!

This repository serves as my practice field for any future projects I'll be working on. 

*This* ReadMe in particular will provide a basis for me to practice markdown for future documentation.

### List of things I still need to do:
1. Learn **Markdown**
2. Learn **proper** programming
3. Eat
  1. None of these items are optional.
  
# Structure

It is important to remember to aways have a structure when creating a project. Without some kind of organization, it will quickly fall apart.

GitHub comes with a powerful markdown language that includes *syntax highlighting*.

For example:

```php
<?php
  function helloWorld() {
    echo "Well, hello there!";
  }
  
  helloWorld();
?>
```

If this code were to run, the terminal would read `Well, hello there!` which means everything is working just fine.

And of course GitHub allows emojis - which means your mind = :boom:

# Task Lists and Tables

A task list can be very useful when documenting, especially when you have to work with other people. By ading a task list, you can define goals or guidelines that the team can follow for the future. For example:

#### To-do List:
- [x] Create a ReadMe file
- [x] **Commit** the ReadMe file
- [ ] **Push** said ReadMe file
- [ ] ???
- [ ] Profit.

Tables are also very useful when you have information that can be grouped together in a way that remains coherent and yet still saves space.

It is important to format them properly as such:

X/Y | X | Y
----|---|---
X | XX | XY
Y | XY | YY

Should show up as a very basic chromosome chart. (~~Thanks Biology~~)
